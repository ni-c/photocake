Theme view files need to be within the /app/View/Themed/ folder. Within the themed folder, create a folder using the same name as your theme name. For example, the above theme would be found in /app/View/Themed/AnotherExample. Its important to remember that CakePHP expects CamelCase theme names. Beyond that, the folder structure within the /app/View/Themed/Example/ folder is exactly the same as /app/View/.

For example, the view file for an edit action of a Posts controller would reside at /app/View/Themed/Example/Posts/edit.ctp. Layout files would reside in /app/View/Themed/Example/Layouts/.

If a view file canâ€™t be found in the theme, CakePHP will try to locate the view file in the /app/View/ folder. This way, you can create master view files and simply override them on a case-by-case basis within your theme folder.
